[HTML, CSS, JavaScript]

This repository contains a video explaining the assignment and files in order to fulfill the requirements for Mastery 7. The website's purpose is to serve as a product page for an online T-shirt company. With the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for logic functionality, it should mimic a real-world e-commerce T-shirt business.

Additionally, the code is labeled with comments on all files. The comments describe the thought process and logic behind the instructed code. If you plan to execute the JavaScript files under its relative folder, make sure you have a compiler installed and functional. When searched from the extensions tab, a popular compiler such as CodeRunner works exceptionally well for running many languages including JavaScript, CPP, C, and Python.
